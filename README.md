<!-- If you're reading this then you must like my README file. If you're wondering
     why my README's an image instead of real contents, it's because I made the
     entire vs-code-preview.md file in VS Code, but GitHub did not make it as nice
     as the VS Code preview (accessed by pressing CMD + Shift + V on a Mac).
     I screenshotted the VS Code preview (the readmeStoryboard.png file) and
     turned THAT into the README, linked to my portfolio site. :)              -->
