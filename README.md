<!-- If you're reading this then you must like my README file. If you're wondering
     why my README's an image instead of real contents, it's because I made the
     entire vs-code-preview.md file in VS Code, but GitHub did not make it as nice
     as the VS Code preview (accessed by pressing CMD (or CTRL on Windows) + Shift + V).
     Instead, I screenshotted the VS Code preview (the readmeStoryboard.png file)
     and just turned THAT into the README, linked to my portfolio site. :) -->
